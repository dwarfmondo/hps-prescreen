### Hello!

I wrote a small program using the standard ruby library (v2.2.3) to perform an HTTP POST request to the end-point described in this documentation http://hps-dev-prescreen.azurewebsites.net.

**Dependencies**
* [Net::HTTP](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.2.3/libdoc/net/http/rdoc/Net/HTTP.html)
* [JSON](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.2.3/libdoc/json/rdoc/JSON.html)
* [URI](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.2.3/libdoc/uri/rdoc/URI.html)
* [rbenv](http://rbenv.org/) â€“ ruby version manager

To execute the program, simply run `ruby prescreen.rb` from your terminal.

It was a fun excercise and I enjoyed working on it. Thanks for the opportunity.
